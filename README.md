# Waftr
2nd Year Software Engineer Project

Built using Meteor, BlazeJS, Node.js and MongoDB.

Our project, Waftr, is a web based application aimed at NUI Galway students. This is designed to be a social hub of activity for students in Galway, consisting of “What’s On” sections, general student-aimed features and a chat room/ message board style area where users can anonymously chat and interact with one another.

/admin will bring you to an administration section where you can alter the mongoDB from the website
